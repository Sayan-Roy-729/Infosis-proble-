# Represent a small bilingual (English-Swedish) glossary given below as a Python dictionary
# {"merry":"god", "christmas":"jul", "and":"och", "happy":"gott", "new":"nytt", "year":"ar"}
# and use it to translate your Christmas wishes from English into Swedish.
# That is, write a python function translate() that accepts the bilingual dictionary and a list of
# English words (your Christmas wish) and returns a list of equivalent Swedish words.
