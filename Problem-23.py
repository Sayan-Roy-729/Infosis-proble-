#  A teacher is in the process of generating a few reports based on the marks scored by the
# students of her class in a project based assessment.
# Assume that the marks of her 10 students are available in a tuple. The marks are out of 25.
# Write a python program to implement the following functions:

# 1. find_more_than_average(): Find and return the percentage of students who have scored
# more than the average mark of the class.

# 2. generate_frequency(): Find how many students have scored the same marks. For
# example, how many have scored 0, how many have scored 1, how many have scored
# 3â€¦.how many have scored 25. The result should be populated in a list and returned.

# 3. sort_marks(): Sort the marks in the increasing order from 0 to 25. The sorted values
# should be populated in a list and returned.
